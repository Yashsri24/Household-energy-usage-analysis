This project analyzes household energy usage data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights through clustering techniques. By exploring the relationships between key metrics such as Global Active Power (kW) and Global Intensity, we aim to group energy usage behaviors into clusters. These clusters help identify trends, anomalies, and potential areas for optimization in household energy consumption.
The project leverages clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment the data and provide actionable insights into energy usage. The results are visualized through scatter plots and other graphical representations, highlighting the distribution and correlation of key variables.
